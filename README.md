# Movies-ETL

## Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to use the Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) method to get data from messy files to a structured database. I gathered movie data from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and MovieLens and transformed the data so it's in good form and merged together in a single table. I then loaded it to postgreSQL for others to analyze.

Applications used: Python, pandas, numpy, SQLAlchemy, and postgreSQL.
